### Performance Evaluation
> Instructors: Mark boxes with 'X' or "n/a" if a section does not apply. Note that "Exceeds Expectations" (3pts) is really only applicable for student writeups or specially marked "*Bonus*" Options.

| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) | Exceeds Expectations (3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Identify: Discuss Data | | |X | |
| Acquire: Load Data with Python | | |X | n/a  |
| Parse: Print Data | | | X| n/a |
| Mine: Sort Data | | |X | n/a |
| Refine: Analyze Data | | || X |
| Present: Visualize Data | | | | X |
| *Bonus! Present: Create blog post summary* | | | | |

- Notes:
Great job Adam! You did a wonderful job doing exploratory analysis and also on your visuals using matplotlib.
